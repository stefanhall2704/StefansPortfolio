        <p className='mt-10'>
          In 2019, I was a Supervisor at a Insulated Metal Panel (IMP) plant.
          And along with the daily tasks I had, along the way, I found different
          tasks that should absolutely be automated. So with not knowing
          anything other than basics in Microsoft Excel. I went to learn about
          simple cell formulas in excel. Once gaining a good amount of knowledge
          on that, I realized it was powerful, but only so powerful. I wound up
          learning VBA, which is a language that is able to be used in excel to
          write scripts that have more power to them. This is what really
          sparked my curiosity of how technology works. <br /> <br />About a year
          later, I found a lot of employees having to manually look for
          supplies, going up and down hallways of shelves. When I thought of a
          way that could fix this issue. Using Microsoft Access's Database. So I
          learned from youtube and documentation of how to use Microsoft Access.
          I created a multi-table database, where users throughout the plant can
          have a user interface within Access, to insert data, change data, and
          relocate the data for where they move supplies. This also ended up
          helping with inventory. <br /><br /> After this I was absolutely hooked into
          tech! I went on to take an attempt on a Coursera course,{" "}
          <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/2FN2YFQEH3BM">
            <strong><em className='hover:underline'>Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS</em></strong>
          </a>
          . I completed this course with honors. And after this. I took a little
          bit of a break from tech. Than about 8 months later, I found an old
          friend that was recently a Site Reliability Engineer at Microsoft and
          was currently an Automation Integration Engineer at CFA Institute. So
          I reached out to him about my interest in tech. And he really helped
          me with his mentorship along the way. <br /><br />
          <h1 className='text-xl' >Mentorship:</h1>
          <br />
          As being a mentee, I went along with numerous suggested tasks provided
          by my mentor. This started out with earning a certificate in{" "}
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/stefhall2704/certificates/6c152bd262967f8c941c9707ed636bda">
          <strong><em className='hover:underline'>Python with codecademy</em></strong>
          </a>
          . This really helped me learn more of the basics in programming. For
          loops, if statements, while loops, OOP, etc. On completion of this
          course. I went for a simple challenge, fizzbuzz. Seemed to be fairly
          simple. But as I quickly discovered, is that was going to be the last
          simple challenge I would have in a long time. My next task, was to use
          free code camp to earn a certificate in{" "}
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/stefan_hall/responsive-web-design">
          <strong><em className='hover:underline'>Responsive Web Design</em></strong>
          </a>
          . This really helped me dig more into web design, which is very
          important in full stack development. With my previous knowledge of
          Python, I went down the route of learning{" "}
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/stefan_hall/data-analysis-with-python-v7">
          <strong><em className='hover:underline'>Data Analysis with Python</em></strong>
          </a>
          . This really showed me a lot of new challenges, using numpy, pandas,
          with Jupyter Notebooks. But really helped me learn that a programming
          language is meant to be a tool. And certain tools work for certain
          tasks. For myself, whenever I need to crunch data, I will definitely
          use python with numpy and pandas. Seems to be very simple to use with
          parsing csv's with dataframes, and even putting the data in graphs.
          Organizing the data in such a way that would make sense for the task,
          etc. <br /> <br /> Following the Data Analysis with Python course, is when I
          was able to land a my first tech job as a Jr. Automation Integration
          Engineer. With all the excitement  in the world, this really showed me
          how humbling being in the tech industry is. At the time, each task
          seemed impossible. So it was a lot of mentoring from my team along the
          way. Really helped me get to the next level. During the first 4
          months, I had a task of going through legacy code, in order to learn
          what the tool was doing. But, unfortunately, this was written in C#.
          Which really wound up being a very difficult problem with me. I have
          had experience in Python, and a bit in JavaScript at this point. So
          learning a new language, still within the first year of hard grinding
          in tech, seemed to pose a huge set of challenges for me. But, with all
          the odds stacked against me, I was able to overcome all the challenges
          it gave me. It took a few months, but was well worth the time. <br /> <br />
          After learning this tools codebase, I had a new challenge, to pair up
          with my teammate, to rewrite the tool using a more modern framework.
          Which obviously at this time, my main experience was with python. We
          ended up using FastAPI as a framework, which has an out of the box
          swagger docs. So this obviously posed its own challenges along the
          way, digging back into the old code base, than back to new codebase,
          to rewrite the functionality in a speedy, but secure way. After taking
          up 10 months of time from our 2 people team on this project, this was
          finally complete. I am recognized as the lead developer of this
          project, where I also used pytest to test our api's, which gives us a
          93% code coverage. <br /> <br /> By the time this was complete, I was
          promoted to a Site Reliability Engineer. This obviously brought a huge
          set of challenges. Learning about SLO's, SLI's, SLA's, helping
          implement opentelemetry in each service for tracing, being able to
          setup grafana with new data sources in order to monitor newly added
          services, tracking upstream and downstream dependencies, etc. A big
          part of what I have learned in this was the grafanalib library. This
          library helped backup all of our dashboards throughout grafana. Even
          using a specific data-source to use with grafanalib to recreate all
          monitoring for our 4 golden signals that we can use to map all of our
          services with there repositories, Azure Monitors App servives,
          corresponding databases for those services, etc.

            Coursera. However, I found that these courses did not teach me about
            frameworks. To overcome this, I decided to undertake the Django
            Girls Tutorial.

            Introduction:
            </h1>
            <br />
            <p>
            As I delved into algorithmic learning, I sought out challenges to
            build my skills, starting with small problems like 2 sum and
            Palindrome on Code Wars. This led me to explore more advanced
            algorithms like binary search, Branch Sums, and Depth First Search,
            which provided a foundation for understanding pathfinding
            algorithms. With so many options to choose from, including DFS, BFS,
            A* Search, Greedy Best-first Search, and Dijkstra's, I decided to
            focus on mastering Dijkstra's algorithm in-depth.

            Skils and Knowledge:
            </h1>
            <br />
            <p>
            To put my knowledge into practice, I challenged myself to build a
            pathfinding algorithm visualizer using JavaScript. The visualizer
            enables users to create a canvas of grids and add starting and
            ending nodes, which then highlights the search in real-time as the
            algorithm progresses through each "cell" of the grid.

            Challenges:
            </h1>
            <br />
            <p>
            I had to overcome numerous challenges throughout the
            development process, including timing the highlighting of squares to
            ensure it was visible to the human eye, adding a user interface to
            control the sequence of highlighted cells, and creating blocks that
            prevented the algorithm from searching in certain cells. These
            challenges required a significant amount of time and effort, but
            ultimately allowed me to better understand how Dijkstra's algorithm
            could be used in a real-world application.

            <p>
            Overall, the project provided me with a deeper understanding of
            Dijkstra's algorithm, allowed me to build my problem-solving
            abilities, and improved my technical skills in JavaScript. I would
            highly recommend this project to any aspiring developer seeking to
            build their skills in algorithmic problem-solving and web
            development.

              With my recent experience in Software Engineering, I took on the challenge of learning the Rust programming language. During the time of learning Rust, I wanted to take on the challenge of learning how to upload and download files to and from a database.

            <p>
              During the time of learning Rust, I had to learn a framework, which I chose Rocket, I chose this due to the similarities that it has with Python's FastAPI and Flask. And I also chose Diesel ORM to interact with the database. And the database of choice was, SQLite. With all of these new skills, it brought a lot of challenges along the way. Learning the different data types that I can utilize in Rust. How to break down a binary file into bytes, and upload it to the database, etc.

            <p>
              This project involoved, taking in a Binary file into bytes, extracting the content type of the file, and taking in a parameter of the file name. And finally, uploading all those attributes to the SQLite database. The second part of this project, is to take in a parameter of an ID. With that parameter, it will take the file, decode it, take the file name, and download it to the users <em>Downloads</em> directory.

            <p>
              After gaining all this knowledge and learning Rust, I found that controlling the memory of my program, gives me a lot more control of what I want to do. Controlling specific types, and learning how the take advantage of the borrow checker and ownership throughout my application and how it can really ensure a secure application, with near native speeds. I absolutely love this project more than the rest, and am really wanting to dive into Rust even more. And would suggest this to anyone in the tech industry.

              DREW is a Cloud Native Change Management Application for the company's website changes. This is deeply integrated with Atlassian tools, such as Jira and Bitbucket. Integrations also made with N8N, which help for automated emails. Other integrations include ADO and Octopus for automatic deployment for branching octopus projects on specified versions that are based off of DREW. With this being said, the automated deployments and pipeline runs in ADO with corresponding repositories, can make life very easy for devops and product owners. At this level of automation, it really helps save the time and money to concentrate on other levels of automation to reduce toil.

            <br />
            <p>
              DREW uses a fairly modern Python framework, FastAPI. This framework really allowed us to have quick developments to create APIs, control authentication for specific levels of access per user within the APIs, and also have swagger docs that come with the FastAPI framework. Throughout this project, I really honed in on my Python skills. And gained a lot of knowledge of SQLalchemy ORM, FastAPI framework, and SQLite database. This really allowed me to take my development skills to the next level. Learning the ins and outs of deeply integrated tooling, how to let an ORM really help the speed of my development of creating APIs increase 10 folds, and really gained knowledge on how to render html with context variables (using Jinja2 templating language) and controlling the data in the front end very easily.

            <p>
              I cannot go into too many specifics, being this is an internal application. There were a few approaches that were taken in this application. Specifically in the frontend, there was a macros.html page that was created, in order to create buttons, modals, etc. We were able to pass in parameters to reuse throughout the application, where the parameters would change the name, the color, and functionality of the button(s) themselves.

            <p>
              This application really helped me learn the ins and outs of creating a new and professional web application from the ground up. But not only that, I really gained a lot of knowledge on how a company deploys there code, down to the level of creating pipelines that are automatically ran when an octopus project is branched, also to the level of using Azure to occasionally swap slots, and Octopus to have automatic rollbacks for when code commits break production. After gaining this knowledge, I also gained a lot of confidence in myself to take on difficult tasks and go through what I need to and run with it.
